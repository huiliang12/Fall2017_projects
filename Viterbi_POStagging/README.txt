Viterbi Part-of-speech Tagger

In this work, I implemented the Viterbi algorithm for part-of-speech tagging.  Specifically, the program will assign words with their Penn Treebank tag. The program will train and test the program on subsets of the Treebank dataset, which consists of documents drawn from various sources with manually annotated part-of-speech tags.
